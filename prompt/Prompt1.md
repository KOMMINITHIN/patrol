Prompt 1 — Codebase Understanding & Constraints
You are working inside an existing full-stack project called "Road Patrol".

Frontend:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Map-based UI (React-Leaflet)

Backend:
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- SQL migrations already exist

DO NOT change existing folder structure or dependencies unless necessary.
First, analyze the current frontend/src and backend/migrations folders and explain the app architecture, data flow, and responsibilities of each major file.
